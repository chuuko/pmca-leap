# pmca-leap
PMCA-Leap is a FLOSS character builder for MikuMikuDance. Forked from the original PMCA, it allows users to create MMD models
without any modelling knowledge.

#What is different about PMCA-Leap?
The interface of PMCA-Leap has an English translation and it can detect your current language settings (at least on Linux).
Furthermore, it is optimized for recent Python versions, thus, it can run under current Linux distributions.
PMCA-Leap aims to be a powerful MMD character creation tool.

#License
The program itself is licensed under LGPL and PSFL, while the modelling materials are in public domain.

#Requirements
Python 3.4 (present in most Linux repositories)
Tkinter
SDL
libpng
libjpeg
libtiff
